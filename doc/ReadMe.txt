The following gives a brief description on LIBMOL (or other name) package

(1) Location of Program Codes:
The source codes and required tables are in a repository located at “compx:   /home/share/libmol-repo/, and can be checked out by bazaar commands
 
(2) Components of Program Codes:
 After check out, the root directory should be LIBMOL, under which the following sub-directories and files should exist, include/, src/, lib/, main.cpp, Makefile.

(3) Installation:
	(a) Type 
		make clean
		make
  		in the root directory where them Makefile resides.
           If the compilation is successful, there should be a binary file  “libmol” under the subdirectory bin/
        (b) Recursively copy all data tables and subdirectories (such as allOrgAngleTables/) under the sub-directory lib/ into $CLIBD_MON (you should have CCP4 suite installed).  Note: do not copy sub-directory lib/ itself to $CLIBD_MON. Those tables and subdirectories (such as allOrgAngleTables/) should be directly under $CLIBD_MON.  

(4) Run the program:
	Two mostly used commands running the program are
       (a)……./LIBMOL/bin/libmol –c your_mmcif_file –r your_3_letter_ligand_code –o your_output_dictionary_file
       (b)……/ LIBMOL/bin/libmol –s your_mol_or_sdf_file –r your_3_letter_ligand_code –o your_output_dictionary_file
           Option:   
           “your_mmcif_file” is a input ligand structural file of mm_cif format, just like those cif files for currently CCP4 dictionary.  
           “your_mol_or_sdf_file” is an input ligand structural file of MOL/SDF format.
           “your_3_letter_ligand_code” is any 3 letter code you would like to use for the ligand.
(5) Program output:
       The successfully completion of  above two commands will produces at least two files. 
       (a)“your_output_dictionary_file” is the library file of mm_cif format, just as those *.lib files generated by “libcheck”
       (b)a file of PDB format contain ligand geometry optimized based on the values of bonds, bond angles, torsions, etc given in “your_output_dictionary_file”. It shares the same name root with “your_output_dictionary_file”, but with extension “.pdb”
